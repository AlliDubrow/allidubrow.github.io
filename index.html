				<p class="first-graph">Despite the high price of tickets, lower tourism numbers than pre-pandemic levels, and the perception of dangerous streets in Times Square, near theaters, Broadway made history this season. <br> 

				<br> Box office numbers have surpassed the pre-pandemic high of people in attendance at shows. So far this season, there has been a 3.46 percent increase in the total gross revenue compared to the 2018-19 season. According to the Broadway League, the 2018-19 season was the highest grossing and best attended season in recorded history. <br>

				<br><iframe title="Total Broadway Gross Revenue: 2015- 2025" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-T2k6Q" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/T2k6Q/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="471" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var t in a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r,i=0;r=e[i];i++)if(r.contentWindow===a.source){var d=a.data["datawrapper-height"][t]+"px";r.style.height=d}}});</script> <br>

				<br> Broadway is experiencing this success most likely due to the star driven shows that have been produced within the last year. Names like George Cloony, James Cordon, Keanu Reeves, Lea Michele, Kristin Chenoweth, etc., have attracted people to the theater. <br> 


				<br>Experts predicted tourism numbers in New York City to bounce back this year, finally reaching or surpassing pre-pandemic numbers. In 2019, 66.8 million visitors went to NYC, the highest the number has been since the COVID-19 pandemic began.<br>

				<br>The recovery of tourists has been stable since the pandemic, with both international and domestic tourism making a comeback. Last year, in 2024, the city welcomed nearly 65 million visitors. Along with tourism, experts were hopeful that Broadway would make a comeback too and reach previous highs. <br> 

				<br>Theatergoers have lots of options when deciding which show they want to see as there are currently 41 Broadway theaters that actively have shows playing. Many people going to see a show like to eat before they see a matinee or evening show. <br>

				<br>Travelers like to think about what are the cheapest options available to them. This applies to hotels, modes of transportation, as well as what to eat when in Times Square.<br>

				<br>Jeffrey Bank, the CEO of the Alicart Restaurant Group explains that tourists have more fast food options now compared to pre-pandemic, and people are choosing to spend less if they can. <br>

				<br>“Right now, you have a lot of tourists, but some of them are not the same spend. In 2019, you didn’t have 52 little fast food joints in Times Square. Now you have everything- Cane’s Chicken, McDonald’s, Taco Bell. These are not places that were commonplace before the pandemic. So the spend is less,” Bank said. As the CEO of the Alicart Restaurant Group, Bank oversees a portfolio of restaurants including Carmine’s Family Style Italian and Virgil’s Real BBQ. <br>
